# Installs Commander

The WIX configuration for this was based on an [article](https://gist.github.com/dasMulli/33beffa15deb1caef373f5b8499082a2) for
utilizing single-file publishing in .Net Core.

## Building the Installer

If needed update the version in Product.wxs file, as well as the main application, then simply build in `Release` mode.
